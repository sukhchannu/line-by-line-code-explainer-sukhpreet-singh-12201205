# line-by-line-code-explainer-sukhpreet-singh-12201205
Line by Line Code Explainer is an AI-powered tool that allows users to paste any piece of code and get a line-by-line explanation of what each line does.


## Project Overview
Paste code, understand it instantly, and learn programming faster.


## Problem Statement
Beginners and even intermediate programmers often struggle to understand unfamiliar code quickly.
Manually analyzing each line is time-consuming, and tutorials or documentation may not explain the logic clearly.


## Solution Summary
We built CodeExplain, an AI web app that lets users paste code snippets and receive line-by-line explanations.
It uses FastAPI + Llama 3 / GPT API to generate plain-language explanations and an overall summary of the code’s functionality, helping learners understand logic instantly.


## Tech Stack
Backend: Python, FastAPI
Frontend: React.js / HTML + CSS / JavaScript
AI / LLM Models: Llama 3 / OpenAI GPT-4
Database : SQLite / PostgreSQL (for storing code snippets or user history)
Deployment / Hosting: Render (backend), Vercel (frontend)
Version Control: Git + GitHub

## Deployment
> The app can be run locally by following the setup steps mentioned above.  
> 1. Start the backend: `uvicorn main:app --reload`  
> 2. Start the frontend: `npm start` in the frontend folder  
> 3. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Features
  - End-to-end working web app (accessible via browser)
  - Implements AI / LLM-based logic to explain code line by line
  - Clean, responsive UI with easy copy/download of explanations
  - Real-world applicability for students, junior developers, and learners


## Technical Architecture
The system allows users to paste code snippets, sends them to an AI model for line-by-line explanations, and returns the results for display.
